# Project Title

Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning

# About

• In this Digital Era, where everyone is using online services and the fake news or misinformation has become very common. 
• To prevent the spread of fake information on social media websites and other online media which may be about political agendas or latest trends, etc. Such news may contain false or exaggerated claims, so a system can be built so that these claims done by the users can be filtered/deleted on the network.
• These fake news or misleading information is also considered to be another form of spam. 
• Solution: A system is to be built, so such "fake news" will be flagged and filtered. This is achieved by training a Machine Learning model which will have datasets of existing sample fake and real news.  
• In addition, as the news keeps updating the dataset, the ML model will also keep updating to a newer version, so it can detect misinformation more efficiently and effectively.

• Azure Machine Learning Studio is to be used after which the model can be deployed as a Web App service.
• In the future, features such as detecting any misinformation on an image/video through OCR can be added. Also, the system can detect any inappropriate content or spam on the network.
• By achieving this, the system aims to make our community a much better, safer, and overall positive place for all the users online.

# Sample Cases from the dataset


`Nate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency. He is currently a member of the leadership team at Common Defense PAC and regional campaign organizer with Veterans Challenge Islamophobia . He is a featured columnist with the Arizona Muslim Voice newspaper. (Reprinted from TomDispatch by permission of author or representative)"`  (FAKE NEWS)

`"Trump takes on Cruz, but lightly","Killing Obama administration rules, dismantling Obamacare and pushing through tax reform are on the early to-do list."` (REAL NEWS)

`Clinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”` (FAKE NEWS)

`Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but he’s far from assured of the majority of delegates he’d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates—and leave without the nomination."` (REAL NEWS)

`Though the results information appears on an FTP server at WorldNow.com, media companies like NBCs WRCB TV utilize the platform, also know as Frankly,to power their news content. This can be verified directly a the WRCB web site by scrolling to the very bottom of the page footer which notes that it is, â€œPowered By Frankly. In addition to national results, Jim Stone has identified another page at the WorldNow.com FTP server that appears to show the State-By-State Presidential election results. This page is also accessible in archive format at WayBack Machine with a line by line breakdown available at Stones website. Of interest is that the State-By-State results indicate a Hillary Clinton win in states like Texas (42% to 40%), Florida (44% to 40%) and Pennsylvania (44% to 40%) which have all been identified as states Clinton must steal to win the election`   (FAKE NEWS)

`For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in."` (REAL NEWS)
